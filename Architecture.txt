The AdaBoost architecture used in the above code is a decision tree ensemble. It consists of a number of weak learners, which are decision trees that are trained on bootstrapped samples of the training data. The weak learners are then combined using a weighted majority vote to form a strong learner.
It oworks by iteratively training weak learners and assigning them weights based on their accuracy. The weak learners that are more accurate are assigned higher weights, and the weak learners that are less accurate are assigned lower weights. The weights of the weak learners are then used to form a weighted majority vote to classify new data points.
The AdaBoost algorithm is a powerful machine learning algorithm that can be used to solve a variety of problems. It is particularly well-suited for problems where the data is noisy or imbalanced.

DecisionTree Classifier Arc

The DecisionTreeClassifier used in the above code is a CART (Classification and Regression Trees) decision tree. CART decision trees are binary decision trees, which means that they can only split the data into two groups at each node. The splitting criteria for CART decision trees is the Gini impurity. The Gini impurity is a measure of how pure a node is. A pure node is a node where all of the data points belong to the same class.
The CART decision tree algorithm works by recursively splitting the data until all of the nodes are pure. The algorithm starts by splitting the data on the feature that has the highest Gini impurity. The algorithm then recursively splits each of the child nodes until all of the nodes are pure.
The CART decision tree algorithm is a powerful tool for classification and regression problems. It is relatively easy to understand and implement, and it can be used to solve a variety of problems. However, CART decision trees can be sensitive to overfitting, which means that they can learn the training data too well and not generalize well to new data.

Initialize the root node of the tree.
While the tree is not pure:
Find the feature that best splits the data at the current node.
Create two child nodes for the current node, one for each of the two groups of data created by the split.
Recursively split each of the child nodes until all of the nodes are pure.
Return the tree.

The algorithm then recursively splits the data at the root node until all of the nodes are pure. A pure node is a node where all of the data points belong to the same class.
The algorithm finds the feature that best splits the data at each node by calculating the Gini impurity of each feature. The Gini impurity is a measure of how pure a node is. A pure node has a Gini impurity of 0, and a node that is not pure has a Gini impurity of 1.
The algorithm then creates two child nodes for the current node, one for each of the two groups of data created by the split. The algorithm then recursively splits each of the child nodes until all of the nodes are pure.
Once the algorithm has split all of the nodes, it returns the tree. The tree can then be used to make predictions on new data.
